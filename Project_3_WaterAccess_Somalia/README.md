## 📌 Project Summary

This project delivers an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights water-access equity and infrastructure gaps across Mogadishu’s CBD and the high-growth districts of Daynile, Hodan, and Kahda. By digitising daily access metrics and infrastructure-status data, the solution simulates real-world planning challenges and transforms them into actionable insights.

The dashboard equips policymakers and NGO partners with:

- Clear visibility of household-level access rates and consumption trends  
- District-by-district comparisons of working, limited, and broken water assets  
- Data-driven evidence to prioritise capital spending, target maintenance, and improve equitable service delivery in resource-constrained environments

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Access to clean, affordable, and equitable water services remains a significant challenge across Somali cities. While population growth accelerates in urban and peri-urban settlements, planning efforts are often hindered by a lack of centralized and accessible water access data.

Current limitations include:
- Fragmented infrastructure records
- Inconsistent population-to-access ratios
- Lack of real-time visual insights for stakeholders

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate water access data for high-growth urban districts
- Create a centralized analytics dashboard to explore coverage rates, equity gaps, and infrastructure needs
- Showcase how Power BI can help urban planners, government units, and NGOs make data-informed decisions
- Embed interactive visuals to illustrate disparities and prioritize future investments

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- **Data quality is foundational:** Clean, context-rich datasets are indispensable for any meaningful infrastructure analysis.  
- **Visual storytelling drives action:** Clear, interactive narratives translate complex water-access data into policy-ready insights.  
- **Local simulation builds empathy:** Replicating on-the-ground infrastructure challenges helps stakeholders understand urgency and prioritize resources.  
- **DAX and dynamic filtering matter:** Well-crafted measures and slicers elevate the dashboard from static reporting to an exploratory decision-support tool.

## 📌 Project Summary
This Power BI dashboard project explores water access and infrastructure gaps across rapidly urbanizing districts in Somalia, including Mogadishu’s CBD and surrounding areas such as Daynile, Hodan, and Kahda.

The aim is to digitize water access data, simulate infrastructure planning challenges, and provide data-driven insights that could hypothetically inform policy, budget allocation, and equitable service delivery in a resource-constrained context.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Access to clean, affordable, and equitable water services remains a significant challenge across Somali cities. While population growth accelerates in urban and peri-urban settlements, planning efforts are often hindered by a lack of centralized and accessible water access data.

Current limitations include:
- Fragmented infrastructure records
- Inconsistent population-to-access ratios
- Lack of real-time visual insights for stakeholders

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate water access data for high-growth urban districts
- Create a centralized analytics dashboard to explore coverage rates, equity gaps, and infrastructure needs
- Showcase how Power BI can help urban planners, government units, and NGOs make data-informed decisions
- Embed interactive visuals to illustrate disparities and prioritize future investments

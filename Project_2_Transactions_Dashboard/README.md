## 🔎 Business Problem

The client needs a dynamic dashboard to analyze financial transaction data across business units. The existing static reports make it difficult to identify anomalies, track performance trends, and optimize decision-making. A centralized, interactive Power BI dashboard is required to drive real-time insights into customer behavior, revenue trends, and operational risks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean, transform, and model transaction data for dashboard reporting.
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) including:
  - Transaction volume by type and channel
  - Average transaction value by customer segment
  - Daily/weekly revenue flow
  - Anomalies and irregular patterns
- Enable cross-filtering by region, customer type, and time period.
- Improve transparency for leadership to take timely strategic action.

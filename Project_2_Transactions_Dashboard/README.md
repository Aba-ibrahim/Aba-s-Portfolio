## 🔎 Business Problem

The client is seeking a centralized, interactive dashboard to analyze financial transactions across multiple business channels. Current static reporting tools lack the agility to surface anomalies, monitor performance trends, or support timely data-driven decisions.

To address this, the business requires a dynamic Power BI solution that enables real-time visibility into key metrics such as customer behavior, revenue performance, refund patterns, and operational risks. The goal is to empower stakeholders with actionable insights that enhance strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

## 🔎 Business Problem

The client is seeking a centralized, interactive dashboard to analyze financial transactions across multiple business channels. Current static reporting tools lack the agility to surface anomalies, monitor performance trends, or support timely data-driven decisions.

To address this, the business requires a dynamic Power BI solution that enables real-time visibility into key metrics such as customer behavior, revenue performance, refund patterns, and operational risks. The goal is to empower stakeholders with actionable insights that enhance strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- **Data Granularity Matters:** Effective financial analysis hinges on the right level of detail. Balancing granularity ensures that dashboards remain both insightful and performant without overwhelming the user.
- **Power of DAX for Custom Insights:** Leveraging DAX measures was instrumental in building flexible KPIs and enabling dynamic filtering, which enhanced the depth of analysis and user interactivity.
- **KPI Design Drives Impact:** Creating KPIs that are directly aligned with strategic business questions ensures the dashboard remains decision-focused and value-driven, rather than just data-rich.
